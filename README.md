# 3MTT Energy Access Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **3MTT Knowledge Showcase - July 2025**, focusing on addressing energy poverty in Nigeria. As a Cohort 3 fellow (Fellow ID: [Your Fellow ID]) in the Data Analysis and Visualization track, I analyzed electricity access trends and proposed a sustainable solar energy solution.

## Problem Statement
Over 70% of rural Nigeria lacks electricity, impacting education, healthcare, and economic growth. This project aims to highlight the issue using data-driven insights.

## Analysis
- **Dataset**: [Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy)
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Findings**:
  - Average electricity access: ~50% (2000-2020)
  - Renewable energy share: ~10-15%
  - Predicted 2030 access: ~70% (using linear regression)
- **Methodology**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries, correlation heatmaps, and AI-based predictions.

## Sustainable Solution
I propose solar energy adoption, including:
- Solar mini-grids for rural Northern regions
- Solar home systems for the South-East
This leverages Nigeria's renewable potential for long-term impact.
